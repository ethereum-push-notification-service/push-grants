4. **Project TL:DR** \
Banana wallet is a smart contract wallet Infrastructure that any application can integrate and provide their users with a UX and security at par with a centralised solution with a non-custodial wallet. 

5. **Proposal Category**
- Other \ Infrastructure

6. **Project Overview** \
A few months back, a centralised crypto platform for staking froze withdrawals, Both my co-founder and I here have funds still stuck on that platform. Lately, we have also seen a few such platforms being hacked or going bust and users losing all their funds. It’s increasingly becoming difficult to trust centralised platforms.

So we started exploring decentralised solutions. But unfortunately, they are **difficult to use**, and it’s time-consuming and **mentally exhausting **to learn all the jargon, create a wallet and get funds on it to do anything. Then there is a threat of compromise of private keys and many smaller UX concerns.

We at Infinito labs are building banana wallet, a **smart contract wallet Infrastructure** that any **application can integrate** and provide their users with a UX and security at par with a centralised solution without compromising on ownership of the user.

We achieve this by using smart contract wallets based on an **account abstraction** solution. This enables us to provide custom features such as zero-knowledge proof-based **two-factor authentication** system. This 2FA prevents a single point of failure, and even if your private key is compromised, **the hacker will not be able to drain users’ funds**.

In our roadmap, we aim to integrate more such functionalities which could improve the UX and security for the user, such as **authentication using touchID and faceID**, social login, self-recovery (without seed phrase) etc.

7. **Value Proposition to Push Protocol** \
All kinds of notifications/ communication with the user is powered using Push protocol.
Currently, when the a hacker makes three wrong attempts, the user is notified wrong attempts are being made and private key might have been compromised. 
In future, notification for transaction, request for transaction, and recovery could be done using push protocol. 


8. **Funding Requested** \
*Figure should be in $PUSH tokens*
$10k in Push tokens

Here is the grant breakup:
- $3500 - 2 Smart Contract dev interns to integrate safe(gnosis safe) and launch on polygon, and optimism
- $1500 - Full stack intern to build SDK
- $2500 - Generalist for user research, designing user experience and BD.
- $1500 - Infra costs
- $1000 - Marketing/ Business Development/ Misc

9. **Milestones** \
Milestone 1: 

- Build the functionality of zk two-factor authentication (fraud management) on the application **(done)**
- Validate the prototype with ~50 users. **(In-progress)**
- Talk to customers to define and refine the needs **(In-progress)**

Milestone 2: 

- Build SDK of two FA(fraud management) **(To-start)**
- Build the functionality of authentication using touch ID **(To-start)**
